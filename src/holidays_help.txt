This package returns country specific holidays in an easy manner.
Currently the package comprises holidays for Germany only. However, some events -- such
as Christmas days -- are also valid for many other countries.

The package comprises two public functions. First, the user calls the holiday()
function for obtaining a bundle of various binary series named according to a specific
holiday. Second, the get_list_of_holidays() function is a convenience function, and
appends the list of series from the previusly returned bundle to the current data set.

Note: The package only works if a time-series data set with periodicity 7 days is active.
